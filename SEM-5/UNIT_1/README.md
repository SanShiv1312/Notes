**-> What is cloud computing?**

Cloud computing is a technology that uses the internet and central remote servers to  maintain data and applications.
It is basically an 'on demand delivery of IT Resources' that are used for computation purpose over the internet with pay per use kind of pricing.

**-> What are the characteristics of Cloud Computing?**
- *On-demand self-service : Based on demand/need one can get the access to computational resources with Internet. (No human intervention)
- *Broad Network Access : Accessible through a wide range of devices(thick to thin)
- *Rapid Elasticity : Fits to dynamic needs conveniently. One can use or drop the resources according to your needs.
- *Agility : The cloud can share resources among the users at a rapid speed and works very fast.
- *High Reliability and Availability : Resources are readily available and the service is highly reliable cause, the chances of infrastructure failure is minimal.
- *Scalability : Cloud can easily manage the workload during peak hours and it can scale up/down based on demand.
- *Maintenance : Maintenance of cloud computing applications is easier, since they do not need to be installed on  each user's computer and can be accessed from  different places. So, it reduces the cost also.
- *Ubiquitous or Device and Location Independence : Cloud resources can be accessed using a web browser anytime and everywhere. Users can connect through the internet from anywhere
- *Cost Effective : Cloud computing provides a solution of IT infrastructure in low cost. Users will pay for what they use and there's no extra expense.
IT company need not to set its own infrastructure and can directly use the readily available resources of cloud.
- *Multi-Sharing : Cloud Computing allows multiple users to work together collaboratively.  Users can share common infrastructure which increases efficiency.
- *Resource Pooling : Cloud provides a pool of resources(plenty) for various needs which are readily available.
- *Measured Service : User's utility will be tracked and monitored by cloud service provider for providing the "Pay per Use" service.

 and also wide range of applications exist that depends on cloud resources

**-> What does Cloud Computing Architecture comprise of ?**
- Front-end : Contains fat clients, thin clients, and mobile devices together framing the Client Infrastructure. (basically used by Clients)
- Back-end : Comprises servers, applications, storage and many others that supports various operations of a client. (managed by service provider)
- Medium :  The barrier or the interface between the Front-end and the back-end parts is the 'Internet' .

**-> What are the components of Cloud Computing Architecture ?**
- Client Infrastructure
- Management
- Application
- Security
- Service
- Cloud Runtime
- Storage
- Infrastructure

**-> What is meant by Cloud Architecture ?**
Cloud architecture is the way technology components combine to build a cloud or it's like Arrangement of different components of cloud, that are used for computation purpose.
- The cloud Architecture include :
* A front-end platform (the client or device used to access the cloud)
* A back-end platform (servers and storage)
* A cloud-based delivery model
* A network
- Front-end gives a request and is delivered to Back-end that gives the response with appropriate resource for utility.

**-> What is Front End Cloud Computing ?**
Front-end is the side that is visible to the client, customer, or  user. Front-end pieces include the user interface, and the  clientâ€™s computer system or network that is used for accessing the cloud system. Front end is essential for connecting the user-end to cloud computing infrastructure.

**-> What is Back End Cloud Computing ?**
Back-end is the part that is used and managed by the service provider.
Back-end basically comprises of  various servers, computers, data storage systems, virtual  machines, and programs. Back-end is like soul for the front-end. Backend empovers the frontend architecture through various computations.  The back-end side also is responsible for providing security mechanisms, traffic control and protocols that connect networked  computers for communication.

**-> Different types of Cloud**
- Private Cloud : accessible at a limited restrictive range
- Public Cloud : accessible by anyone(public)
- Hybrid Cloud : comprised of both public and private types of cloud
- Community Cloud : maintained and shared by single or multiple organizations

**-> What is private cloud?**
The private cloud is defined as computing services offered either over the internet or a private internal network and only to selective users instead of the general public.
* Advantages :
- High security and Privacy
- Customizable
- More Control
- Improved Performance
* Disadvantages :
- High cost
- Limited Scalability
- Inflexible price
- Restricted area of operations

**-> What is Public Cloud?**
The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. In a public cloud, all hardware, software and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the cloud provider.
* Advantages :
- High scalability
- Cost reduction
- Disaster Recovery
- Location Independent
- Reliability and flexibility
* Disadvantages :
- low Security
- Less customizable

**-> What is Hybrid Cloud?**
A hybrid cloud is one in which applications are running in a combination of different environments. This cloud connects public and private resources according to the need of the user. Non-critical activities are  performed by public cloud while critical  activities are performed by private cloud.
* Advantages :
- Cost Effective
- Scalable
- Flexible & Secure
* Disadvantages :
- Network issues
- Security Compliance

**-> What is Community Cloud?**
Community cloud computing refers to a shared cloud computing service environment that is targeted to a limited set of organizations or employees.
It allows systems and service to be accessible by group of organizations.
* Advantages :
- Security
- Compliance
- Controlled level of privacy
- More Control
* Disadvantages :
- Limited remote access
- More maintenance costs

**-> What are the Challenges of Cloud-Computing?**
- Down-time problem(stable internet access is needed)
- vendor lock-in(more restrictions)
- Security is not 100%
- Selection of service provider(good reputation should be there)
- Performance concerns
- Password security(Complexity with multiple verification that is needed for Authentication

**-> What are the basic Service models of Cloud Computing?**
Service Models are the reference models on which the Cloud Computing is based. These can be categorized  into three basic service models as listed below:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

**-> Give a short note on IaaS**
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the delivery of technology infrastructure as an on  demand scalable service. It is also known as "Hardware as a service". IaaS provides access to fundamental resources such as  physical machines, virtual machines, virtual storage, etc.
- It is a service by given cloud service provider like servers, storage, VM's and other computational resources on demand.
- Famous IaaS providers were  Amazon, EC2, Tata, GoGrid, Sifi Technologies, Reliance, etc.

**-> Give a short note on PaaS**
Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides the runtime environment for applications,  development & deployment tools, etc.
It provides the computing platforms which typically includes operating system, programming language execution environment, database, web server etc. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure
In other terms, Paas is like on demand access to a complete, ready to use cloud hosted platform for developing, running, maintaining and managing applications.
- Famous PaaS providers were Azure, AWS, Openshift, Google Cloud Platform , etc.

**-> Give a short note on SaaS**
Software as a Service (SaaS) model allows to use software applications as a service to end users.
It is a software distribution model in which a cloud provider hosts applications and makes them available to end users over the internet.
- Famous SaaS providers were Salesforce, Google, Microsoft, Freshworks, etc.
