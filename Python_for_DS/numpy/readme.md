#### About `NumPy`
- NumPy is the general short form of `Numerical Python` and was developed in 2005 by Travis Oliphant.
- **NumPy** is a library or like a package for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- It has many operations like multidimensional array object, various derived objects, and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more...
- NumPy has some built-in functions for linear Algebra and random number generation
- NumPy is like much better replacement for `lists` of traditional py and provides an array object which is much faster than traditional Python lists.

#### Getting started

##### Importing our package [`NumPy`]
- Once NumPy is installed, import it in your applications by adding the `import` keyword:
        `import numpy` 

Now NumPy is imported and we can use it.
- Example
```
import numpy

arr = numpy.array([45,18,7,13,12])

print(arr)

```
- otherwise we can also use other the other way of importing numpy as np as below
     `import numpy as np`
