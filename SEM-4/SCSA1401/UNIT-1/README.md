## UNIT-1 `AN OVERVIEW OF OBJECT ORIENTED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT`

**Object-oriented analysis and design** (OOAD) is a software engineering approach that models a system as a group of interacting objects. Each object represents some entity of interest in the system being modeled, and is characterized by its class, its state (data elements), and its behavior.
- Object is a combination of data and logic that represents some real world entity.
- `Data` are termed as `Attributes` and also _`Logic`_ is termed as _`Functions`_.  

- The primary tasks in object-oriented analysis (OOA) are âˆ’

   -  Identifying objects.
   -  Organizing the objects by creating object model diagram.
   -  Defining the internals of the objects, or object attributes.
   -  Defining the behavior of the objects, i.e., object actions.
   -  Describing how the objects interact.


### `BASIC DEFINITIONS`

### -> **OBJECT** :
An object is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful
- Object is an instance of a class.
- From a programming point of view, an object in OOPS can include a data structure, a variable, or a function.
- An object is an entity.
   - It knows things(availability of attributes)
   - It does things(contains methods)
