## UNIT-1 `AN OVERVIEW OF OBJECT ORIENTED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT`

**Object-oriented analysis and design** (OOAD) is a software engineering approach that models a system as a group of interacting objects. Each object represents some entity of interest in the system being modeled, and is characterized by its class, its state (data elements), and its behavior.
- Object is a combination of data and logic that represents some real world entity.
- `Data` are termed as `Attributes` and also _`Logic`_ is termed as _`Functions`_.  

- The primary tasks in object-oriented analysis (OOA) are âˆ’

   -  Identifying objects.
   -  Organizing the objects by creating object model diagram.
   -  Defining the internals of the objects, or object attributes.
   -  Defining the behavior of the objects, i.e., object actions.
   -  Describing how the objects interact.


### `BASIC DEFINITIONS`

### -> **Class** :
A class is a `blueprint` for creating objects. It can also be stated as a "template for the objects"
- It is a user-defined type that describes what a certain type of object will look like
- Collection of objects is called class. It is a `logical entity`.
- Class doesn't consume the space and is used for declaring and creating the objects.

### -> **OBJECT** :
Object is an `instance of a class`. An object in OOPS is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful. An Object is anything, real or abstract, about which we store data and
those methods that manipulate the data.
- In an object-oriented system, everything is an object: numbers, arrays,
records, fields, files, forms, an invoice, etc.
- A object is an `entity`
    - It knows things (availability of attributes)
    -  It does things (provides methods)
