## UNIT-1 `AN OVERVIEW OF OBJECT ORIENTED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT`

**Object-oriented analysis and design** (OOAD) is a software engineering approach that models a system as a group of interacting objects. Each object represents some entity of interest in the system being modeled, and is characterized by its class, its state (data elements), and its behavior.
- Object is a combination of data and logic that represents some real world entity.
- `Data` are termed as `Attributes` and also _`Logic`_ is termed as _`Functions`_.  

- The primary tasks in object-oriented analysis (OOA) are −

   -  Identifying objects.
   -  Organizing the objects by creating object model diagram.
   -  Defining the internals of the objects, or object attributes.
   -  Defining the behavior of the objects, i.e., object actions.
   -  Describing how the objects interact.


### `BASIC DEFINITIONS`

### -> **OBJECT** :
Object is an instance of a class. An object in OOPS is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful.
   - In an object-oriented system, everything is an object: numbers, arrays,
records, fields, files, forms, an invoice, etc.
 An Object is anything, real or abstract, about which we store data and
those methods that manipulate the data.
 Conceptually, each object is responsible for itself.
 A window object is responsible for things like opening, sizing, and
closing itself.
 A chart object is responsible for things like maintaining its data and
labels, and even for drawing itself.
