# Unit-1 `Probability Concepts and Random Variable`

### ->**Experiment** :
- In Probability, Experiment or Trail is an attempt that can be `infinitely repeated` and has a well defined `set of possible outcomes`(Sample space).
- The experiment will always results in something.

Based on number of possible results in an experiment, we can classify  the experiments as two types
- **Deterministic**
- **Probabilistic**

#### -->**Deterministic Experiment** :
The Experiments which have only one possible result or outcome i.e. whose result is certain or unique.
- Also known as "Predictable Experiments"
- Result can be predicted with certainty and is known prior to its conduct.

#### -->**Probabilistic Experiment** :
Experiments whose result is uncertain or unpredictable.
- Also known as "Indeterministic Experiments"
- The different possible outcomes can be known or assessed and the outcomes cannot be predicted before to its conduction.
- This can have more than one possible outcome.
