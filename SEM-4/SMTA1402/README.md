# Unit-1 `Probability Concepts and Random Variable`

### ->**Experiment** :
- In Probability, Experiment or Trail is an attempt that can be `infinitely repeated` and has a well defined `set of possible outcomes`(Sample space).
- The experiment will always results in something.
- * _**Example** :_
**Event or Trail** : `Tossing TWO coins`
then,
- _(Sample space)_ S = {HH, HT, TH, TT} and also "n" = 2(number of coins)
- |S| = _number of possible elements_ = `2^n`

### ->**Event** :
A probability event can be defined as a `set of outcomes` of an experiment
- A sub-set of Sample space(S) consisting of possible outcomes.
- * _**Example** :_
Getting one tail (From the above given example)
`E1` = { HT, TH, TT}
n(E1) = 3.


Based on number of possible results in an experiment, we can classify  the experiments as two types
- **Deterministic**
- **Probabilistic**

#### -->**Deterministic Experiment** :
The Experiments which have only one possible result or outcome i.e. whose result is certain or unique.
- Also known as "Predictable Experiments"
- Result can be predicted with certainty and is known prior to its conduct.

#### -->**Probabilistic Experiment** :
Experiments whose result is uncertain or unpredictable.
- Also known as "Indeterministic Experiments"
- The different possible outcomes can be known or assessed and the outcomes cannot be predicted prior to it's conduct.
- This can have more than one possible outcome.
