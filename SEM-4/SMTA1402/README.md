# Unit-1 `Probability Concepts and Random Variable`

#### ->**Experiment** :
- In Probability, Experiment or Trail is an attempt that can be `infinitely repeated` and has a well defined `set of possible outcomes`(Sample space).
- The experiment will always results in something

Based on number of possible results in an experiment, we can classify  the experiments as two types
- **Deterministic**
- **Probabilistic**

#### -->**Deterministic Experiment**
The Experiments which have only one possible result or outcome i.e. whose result is certain or unique.
- Also known as "Predictable Experiments"
- An experiment whose outcome or result can be predicted with
certainty is called a Deterministic experiment
