# **`INTERFACING`**

### **`PROGRAMMABLE PERIPHERAL INTERFACE 8255`**

PPI 8255 is a general purpose programmable I/O device designed to interface the CPU with its outside world such as ADC, DAC, keyboard etc. We can program it according to the given condition. It can be used with almost any microprocessor.
- It is a `40-pin` IC and operates in `+5V` regulated power supply(DC).
- It is a `dual in-line package` that means it will have the equal number of pins on either sides(20 each).
- IC8255 acts as an `interface` between the MP(microprocessor) and the I/O(input/output) device.
- I/O ports are further divided into three `bi-directional` ports i.e. **PORT A, PORT B and PORT C** (8 pins each).
