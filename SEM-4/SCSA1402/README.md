### `VON NEUMANN MODEL` : 
Von-Neumann proposed his computer architecture design in 1945 which was later known as **Von-Neumann Architecture**. It consisted of a `Control Unit`, `Arithmetic`, and `Logical Memory Unit` (ALU), `Registers` and `Inputs/Outputs`.

Von Neumann architecture is based on the stored-program computer concept, where instruction data and program data are stored in the same memory. This design is still used in most computers produced today.
