# UNIT-1 `CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT`

#### **Architecture** :
Specification dealing how a set of software and hardware technology standards interact to form a computer system.
- It can also be termed as "how a computer is designed to satisfy the needs of user".
- Computer architecture is a "set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems".

### **`VON NEUMANN MODEL`** : 
Von-Neumann proposed his computer architecture design in 1945 which was later known as **Von-Neumann Architecture**. It consisted of a `Control Unit`, `Arithmetic`, and `Logical Memory Unit` (ALU), `Registers` and `Inputs/Outputs`.

Von Neumann architecture is based on the stored-program computer concept, where instruction data and program data are stored in the same memory. This design is still used in most computers produced today.

**Components of Von-Neumann Model** : 

- `Central Processing Unit` 
- `Buses` 
- `Memory Unit`   


###  **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** : 
The part of the Computer that performs the bulk of data processing operations is called the Central Processing Unit and is referred to as the `CPU` 

- The CPU performs a variety of functions dictated by the type of instructions that are incorporated in the computer.

- It is sometimes referred to as the `microprocessor` or `processor`.

- The major components of CPU are `Arithmetic and Logic Unit` (ALU), `Control Unit` (CU) and a variety of registers.


### **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)** : 

The Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) performs the required micro-operations for executing the instructions. In simple words, ALU allows arithmetic (add, subtract, etc.) and logic (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) operations to be carried out.

-  It is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. 

-  In some microprocessor architectures, the ALU is divided into the arithmetic and the logic units.

### **Control Unit (CU)** : 
The Control Unit of a computer system controls the operations of components like ALU, memory and input/output devices.

The Control Unit consists of a program counter that contains the address of the instructions to be fetched and an instruction register into which instructions are fetched from memory for execution.

- The control unit also provides the timing and control signals required by other computer components.
