#### SOFTWARE PARADIGM
_Software paradigm_ refers to the methods and steps , which are to be taken while designing the software
 It basically consists of three parts.
- Software development paradigm
- Software design paradigm
- Programming paradigm

#### Software development paradigm
_Software development paradigm_ which is also known as `software engineering` is related to all the engineering concepts which
includes Requirements, software design, programming, etc.

#### Software design paradigm
_Software design paradigm_ is a part of software development and it includes design,
programming and  maintenance

#### Programming paradigm
_Programming paradigm_ is a way to classify programming language based on their application and features offered by it.
It in fact concerns about the programming aspect of software development. This includes coding, testing, integration.

### Need for Software Engineering ðŸ‘€
- Specific software is needed almost everywhere in our life
- To be able to construct trust-worthy and reliable systems efficiently and effectively in less time
- Software engineering fulfills the higher rate of change in user requirement and environment

### Qualities of a good software ðŸ™Œ
- `Correctness`:
Correctness is important for good software. There shouldnâ€™t be faults with specification, design or implementation.

- `Usability` :
Users should be able to learn and use a system easily.

- `Efficiency` :
The less resource a piece of software uses, the better. Processor, memory and disk space usage should be minimized.

- `Reliability` :
A system that can perform the required functions stably is important. Failures should be as rare as possible.

- `Integrity` :
Security should be taken into account. Our software should let attackers access unauthorized resources.
Also, data validation is important so that bad data canâ€™t be saved into the system.

- `Adaptability` :
A system that can be used without modification for different situations itâ€™s good.

- `Accuracy` :
The accuracy of its outputs is good. This measures if the software outputs the right results for users.

- `Robustness` :
If a system is still working after getting invalid inputs and stressful environmental conditions, then itâ€™s good for our system.

- `Maintainability` :
The ease in which an existing system can be changed is important. The easier that we can make changes, the better.

- `Portability` :
A system that operates in different environments from which itâ€™s originally designed makes it good.

- `Reusability` :
The more reusable parts that a piece of software has, the better.
Using reusable parts means that we donâ€™t have to reuse them from scratch.

- `Readability` :
Easy to read code is easy to change code. If we understand them faster, then we can make changes faster and in a less error-prone way.

- `Testability` :
Making our software system testable is critical. If our code is easy to write unit tests for, then thatâ€™s good.

- `Understandability` :
The ability for us to understand our system in a global view or at the detailed code level is important.
Easier to understand systems are more coherent.
With good software, itâ€™s harder for us to create defects, and itâ€™s faster to make changes.

**Further classification of Qualities**
The software product can be judged by what it offer and how well it can be used .
furthermore, the software must satisfied on the following grounds :
- _Operational_
- _Transitional_
- _Maintenance_

- a) `Operational`
Operational defines how well the software works in operations. It can be measure
on budget, usability, efficiency, correctness, functionality, dependability, security, safety.

- b) `Transitional`
This aspect is important if the software is moved from one platform to another.
The key parameters that includes portability, Interoperability, Reusability, Adaptability.

- c) `Maintenance`
Maintenance of the software defines the capabilities to maintain itself in the ever
changing environment. It includes modularity, maintainability, flexibility etc.

### What does the term `'SOFTWARE'` mean !? ðŸ¤”
Here's a set of definitions collected from various sources ðŸ˜‰
- **Software** is considered as a _set of programs_, which is designed to perform a well-defined function
-  set of instructions which when executed gives a desired output or function
-  Software is considered to be collection of _executable programming code_, associated libraries and documentations

### Software Engineering ðŸ¤ž
-  Software engineering is the establishment and use of sound engineering
principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable and works
efficiently on real machines
- Software Engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable
approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is,
the application of engineering to software.
- Software engineering is a discipline whose aim is the production of fault-free
software, delivered on time and within budget, that satisfies the clientâ€™s needs.

####  Layered technology
- Software engineering is a fully layered technology.
- To develop a software, we need to go from one layer to another.
- All these layers are related to each other and each layer demands the fulfillment of the previous layer.
