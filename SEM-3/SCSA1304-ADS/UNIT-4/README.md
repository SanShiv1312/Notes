#### Spanning Tree
- Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all, the vertices together.
- A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges.
##### Properties :
- A connected graph can contain more than one spanning tree.
-  The spanning trees which are minimally connected or we can say that the tree which is having a minimum total edge weight would be considered as the minimum spanning tree.
- All the possible spanning trees that can be created from the given graph G would have the same number of vertices, but the number of edges in the spanning tree would be equal to the number of vertices in the given graph minus 1.
- The spanning tree does not contain any loops and parallel edges.
- `*Loops*` refers to the edges that has the same start and ending vertex and `*parallel edges*` are the multiple edges between the same vertices.
- Each connected and undirected graph contains at least one spanning tree.
- The disconnected graph does not contain any spanning tree.

#### `Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)`
- Spanning tree of graph whose sum of weights of edges is minimum.
- A graph can have more than one MST.
- For a Graph containing 'n' vertices, there will a MST with 'n' vertices and 'n-1' edges.
- MST is the one spanning tree that contains least weight when added combinedly.
