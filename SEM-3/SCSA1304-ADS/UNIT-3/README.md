## `GRAPHS`

#### Introduction :
- A Graph is a `non-linear data structure` consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph
- The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as `vertices`, and the links that connect the vertices are called `edges`
- Data structure `Graph` is similar to tree , but differs from tree by having a **enclosed loop**.
- In simple words, graph is the collection of verticies and edges, but you can bring out the cycles or the loops.
- `All trees are graphs, but not all graphs can be trees`
